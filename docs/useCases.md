## Essentials

- As a patient, I would like to have a list of the meds I take
- As a patient, I want an alarm system to remind me to take my meds
- As a patient, I want the app to remember if I have taken my pills, so I don't double take
- As a patient, I would like a quick access button to confirm or skip a dose
- As a patient, I would like to have an inventory count and a notification for when it's time to refill

## Nice to have

- As a patient, I want to have a diary of one off meds that I take (OTC, PRN, vitamins, ...)
- As a patient, I want a calender and alarm system to remind me of my appointments
- As a patient, I would like the app to store/view my test (blood test, scans, ...)
- As a patient, I would like a health diary (measurements, symptoms, ...)
- As a patient, I would like a quick overview of my meds and the frequency take them (including last OTC date) for my hospital visits
- As a patient, I would like a quick refill function (refill multiple meds with a predefined value like from a list of prescriptions)
- As a patient, I want to have my data backed up to a cloud storage in case I lose my phone (should be opt-in and have options to choose which data to be stored +bonus if self-hosted)
- As a patient, I would like to be notified if any of my meds have interactions with each other
- As a patient, I would like the ability to add a a schedule to taper down or increase my medicine dosage
